Why?

config parsing
reddit/fb

resistant to bugs
- if you add a new item to a config then you'll get an error,
  if you misspell a keyword argument you'll get an error
  keyword arguments always have exactly the same name as config name
very ergonomic
very compact
good error messages in your templates, since they name the class
