# get jinja 2
# get pyyaml
# write readme
# load yaml file
# splat into objects

config parsing
post on reddit

resistant to bugs
- if you add a new item to a config then you'll get an error,
  if you misspell a keyword argument you'll get an error
  keyword arguments always have exactly the same name as config name
very ergonomic
very compact
good error messages in your templates, since they name the class
